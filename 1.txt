To set up a flow where ground owners register, get verified by an admin, and then register grounds, you could implement the following steps:

Ground Owner Registration:

Create a form where ground owners can register with their details (e.g., name, email, contact, etc.).
Save their registration status as "pending" until verified by an admin.
Admin Verification:

Set up an admin dashboard to view all pending ground owners.
Provide "Approve" or "Reject" options in the dashboard. Once approved, the ground owner's status is updated to "verified."
Ground Registration:

Only verified ground owners can access the ground registration form.
You can add a check in the backend to ensure that only ground owners with a verified status can register grounds.
Database Schema Adjustments:

In your user schema, add fields like role (e.g., "admin" or "ground_owner") and status (e.g., "pending," "verified").
Update your ground schema to associate each ground with a verified ground owner, e.g., ownerId.
Frontend Logic:

Show the ground registration page only to verified ground owners.
In the admin dashboard, show a list of all registered grounds, with the option for the admin to manage them.
